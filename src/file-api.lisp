;;;; Merge fuctionality

;; What fact do we have available to make sync work?

;; 1) We can get update since some ts. Ts should be server time.
;;    We get notifications about new and updated posts.

;; 2) There is no nonhacky way of getting update ts from the
;;    post response by itself, however lj-getevents returns sync timestamp
;;    to us

;; Sounds like we have enough information to do a sync! We can split task
;; in three:

;; 1) Whenever we create/update post, we poke livejournal server to get
;;    a timestamp and store it along the post.

;; 2) Whenever we fetch updated items, we store update timestamp of every
;;    one of them along with post response.

;; Given these two last step is easy!

;; 3) Whenever we merge we take all raw posts that either do not exist as
;;    markdown or markdown has update ts ealier then raw server response
;;    and convert raw response to the markdown which is then save two the disk
;;    potentially replacing old file.

;; Sounds like a plan! The only two words that need clarification are `convert`
;; and `save` on a disk. Let's start with `save`.

;; How can we get the name?

;; 1) If particular itemid is already in db use the name from there.

;; 2) If not, take date from event time as a base. If title exists,
;;    slagify it the best effort.

;; 3) Filename exists? Add -N to the end starting from 1 onwards till we
;; find an empty spot.

;; How do we convert?

;; 1) We walk over the structure. Atom is either a number or a string
;;    or a list with car :base64 and cdr containing some base64 encoded
;;    utf8 text.

;; 2) We save title as is, map fields to the supported flag.

;; 3) Flags can be marked as ignored, otherwise they cause a restart.

;; 4) Body text is markdownified, lj embeds are unwrapped.

;; That's it
